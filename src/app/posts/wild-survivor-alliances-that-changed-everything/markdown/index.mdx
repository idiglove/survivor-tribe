# Wild Survivor Alliances That Changed Everything

Alliances have been an integral part of the hit reality TV show Survivor since its inception. From the very first season, contestants quickly realized that forming strong bonds and working together was key to making it far in the game.

Over the years, we've seen numerous alliances shape the course of a season—some successful, some not so much. But one thing remains clear: the ability to navigate the complex social dynamics and build trust with fellow castaways is essential to becoming the Sole Survivor.

## The Most Iconic Alliances in Survivor History

Throughout Survivor's 40+ seasons, several alliances have left an indelible mark on the game. Perhaps **the most famous is the original Tagi alliance from season one**, consisting of Richard Hatch, Kelly Wiglesworth, Rudy Boesch, and Sue Hawk. This fearsome foursome set the blueprint for alliance strategy, dominating the game physically and strategically en route to the show's first-ever final four.

Another legendary alliance emerged in **Survivor: Micronesia—the Black Widow Brigade**. Composed of Amanda Kimmel, Parvati Shallow, Cirie Fields, Natalie Bolton, and Alexis Jones, these five women masterfully controlled the post-merge game. Utilizing a potent combination of strategic prowess, social manipulation, and challenge strength, they systematically eliminated the men and **orchestrated some of the most memorable blindsides the game has ever seen.**

In recent years, one alliance has proven that sometimes all you need is one loyal ally. Dubbed "**Cops R Us," Sarah Lacina and Tony Vlachos** have shown that a dynamic duo can go far in Survivor. The two have played together three times, with Sarah winning Game Changers and Tony emerging victorious in both Cagayan and Winners at War. Their games are built on implicit trust and a willingness to adapt their strategy—a formula that has taken them to the end twice when playing together, not perfect but we can say it went beyond a single season. Personally, I think this alliance tops it all as they have dominated other players across 3 seasons, they were really fun to watch too. Imagine playing with someone who you have to always second guess when you need to trust or betray, that takes a lot of trust-building and adaptability.

Other iconic Survivor alliances include:

- **Survivor Africa:** The Ethan, Lex and Tom alliance where it displayed a pivotal moment in Survivor history that a contestant deliberately lost a challenge to benefit an alliance. This resulted to Ethan winning the whole thing due to the support of Lex and Tom which demonstrates the effectiveness of their collaboration.
- **Stealth R Us:** The alliance from Redemption Island led by Boston Rob.
- **Coconut Bandits Alliance:** The strategic alliance from Blood Vs Water season.
- **Witches Coven Alliance:** From Survivor Cambodia which plays a role in the "big moves era" featuring prominent female players and villains.
- **The Rotu 4**: The dominant alliance in Marquesas that controlled the game until a power shift at the final nine changed Survivor strategy forever
- **The Aitu 4**: The underdog comeback. Yul Kwon, Becky Lee, Sundra Oakley, and Ozzy Lusth defied the odds in Cook Islands, sticking together despite being down in numbers post-merge
- **The Villains Tribe**: In Heroes vs. Villains, a group of Survivor's biggest personalities banded together to decimate the Heroes post-merge, led by Russell Hantz, Parvati Shallow, and Danielle DiLorenzo
- **The Three Amigos**: Malcolm Freberg, Reynold Toepfer, and Eddie Fox were on the bottom in Caramoan, but their bold moves and idol plays took out some power players
- **The David Alliance**: The underdogs on the David tribe in David vs. Goliath formed a loyal group that ran the game post-merge, led by Nick Wilson, Davie Rickenbacker, and Christian Hubicki

While not always the most likable or heroic, these alliances have indisputably shaped Survivor history through their loyalty, strategic maneuvering, and sheer dominance. They're the kind of iconic groups that make fans excited to tune in each week, eager to see the social game unfold and alliances tested—the captivating journey that keeps viewers coming back season after season to shows like Survivor Tribe.
