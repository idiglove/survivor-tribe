# Survivor 47 cast photos after the Finale (SPOILER)

We had new castaways for Season 47. There were no returning players - a recurring theme since Season 40 (Winners at War). The bunch was from Podcasters to Pilot School Owners!

Explore the photos below of some of the jury and other cast members after the finale

## **Rachel LaMont**

Guess who won the title of Sole Survivor? Rachel LaMont!
She played a strong social game and was able to secure the votes of the jury. She was also a challenge beast, winning four immunity challenges throughout the season.

## **Sam Phalen**

A very strategic guy, Sam Phalen was able to make it to the Final Tribal Council by winning a very intense fire-making challenge. He was pretty convincing in the final tirbel of his gameplay, but ultimately fell short to Rachel.

## **Sue Smey**

The most loyal in the game. She hid her age and her hidden immunity idol. Very sneaky but fell short in the end.

## **Teeny Chirichillo**

She was entertaining to watch because she was always confused on what other players were doing. She was able to make it to the Final Four but lost in the intense fire-making challenge to Sam.

## **Genevieve Mushaluk**

Had a respectful rivalry with Rachel. Fun to watch and could have been a great winner too.
