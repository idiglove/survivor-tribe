It's already past 2 weeks since the finale. However, people are still buzzing about Survivor 47. It's one of the best ones out of the New Era of Survivor.

# Survivor 47 - Did the fire making challenge steal the show for the Finale?

**Here are top 3 moments of the exciting finale:**

## **The Last Immunity Challenge**

The finale featured an intense immunity challenge that combined a long winding physical challenge with a creative puzzle. Sam initially took the lead in the physical segment.

But then Rachel was on his tail, and she then completed all the puzzle pieces that looks like a bat highlighting modern game mechanics (really creative there Survivor producers!). Jeff comes in to check, and there was a one puzzle that looked oddly placed!

Rachel took another look, and in a minute she fixed it and she grabbed her fourth immunity idol securing her place in the Final Tribal Council.

## **Fire-Making Challenge**

The fire-making challenge has become a hallmark of the New Era of Survivor, and this season was no exception. With Rachel choosing to take Sue to the final three, Sam and Teeny faced off in the fire-making contest.

Although a lot of fans are opposed to the fire making challenge as the last battle to get into the top 3, Teeny and Sam's face-off really was a nail biter as Teeny was able to spark a fire first which led to a pretty big fire. Then somehow, Sam came in fast with fire that grew as big as Teeny's.

And the good old wind came knocking in, if only Teeny had the sense of mind to block the wind then she could have won. Instead, we have a Final Tribal Council of Sue, Rachel and Sam.

There's a polarizing take about the fire challenge from Rachel. From one interview she said:

> I don't love fire because I think that at this phase in Survivor, probably half the time we'd end up in a two-two [split vote] anyway [in the final four] and go to fire [as a tiebreaker]. So I don't understand why we just can't have a normal vote

## **Rachel Makes History**

Rachel's gameplay throughout the season has been nothing short of remarkable. Her ability to gather information stealthily and her strong social connections were pivotal in her success. But to be fair, for a second there, I thought Sam would win the finale. He was so convincing and sold his position to the jury and also to the viewers.

But ultimately, it weighed down on what Rachel has done behind the scenes that only the jury has seen, how she has navigated socially and her superb performance in the challenges. Finally, Rachel was officially crowned the winner of Survivor 47.

This win not only cements her place in Survivor history but also demonstrates the evolving dynamics among Survivor contestants in recent seasons. Fans continue to discuss these moments on platforms like Inside Survivor and Reddit, reflecting on how this season has redefined what it means to compete in Survivor's modern landscape.

P.S. On a side note, here's my take on how Sue could have won Survivor 47:

> Sue could have won if, she flipped when Rachel didn't get the immunity, it could have been her biggest chance. I don't know if she has the balls to do it, but if she could muster the courage and teamed up with Sam and Andy to vote Rachel out, that would I believe garner alot of jury votes.
